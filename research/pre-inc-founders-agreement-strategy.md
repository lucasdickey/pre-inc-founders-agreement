# Pre-Incorporation Founders Agreement: Strategic Analysis

## Why Stripe Atlas Should Sponsor This

### The Strategic Opportunity

There's an **extended gap**—often months to years—between when founders start working together and when they incorporate. During this period:

- Founders create informal agreements (trust-based, often unenforceable)
- They build relationships with tools and services
- They form opinions about who to trust when the stakes get higher

**Stripe has no presence in this window today.** Atlas enters the picture at incorporation—but by then, founders have already:
- Chosen their lawyers (Clerky, Cooley, WSGR)
- Picked their cap table software (Carta, Pulley)
- Formed preferences about who "gets" startups

The Pre-Incorporation Founders Agreement is a **wedge into the pre-incorporation relationship**—a low-stakes, high-value touchpoint that creates affinity before the money flows.

### The Competitive Moat

| Competitor | Pre-Inc Offering | Weakness |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| Clerky | None (starts at incorporation) | Misses pre-inc window |
| Carta | None (starts at cap table) | No founder alignment tool |
| LegalZoom | Generic templates | No startup context, no workflow |
| Lawyers | Bespoke drafting ($2K+) | Cost-prohibitive pre-PMF |
| ChatGPT/Claude | Can generate docs | No persistence, no collaboration, no ecosystem |

**No one owns this moment.** Founders currently Google templates, self-draft, or skip it entirely.

## Value to Customers/Users

### What Founders Actually Need (from UXR)

| Need | Quote | How This Tool Addresses It |
|------|-------|----------------------------|
| **Trust baseline** | "More like a handshake... insurance if something goes south" — Rishi | Structured document creates mutual understanding |
| **Cost avoidance** | "I didn't want to invest in lawyers before we figured out we had a product" — Rishi | Free tool, no legal fees required |
| **IP protection** | "Primary drivers were IP. If something fell apart, we knew what it would look like" — Nicole | Explicit IP assignment section |
| **Equity clarity** | "10 people all had equity, needed documentation" — Rishi | Captures splits, vesting, cliffs for all founders |
| **Role alignment** | "No formal role/time commitment/titling—it would have been a good idea" — Nicole | Explicitly asks about roles, responsibilities, commitment |
| **Smooth transition** | "We just did a parallel agreement that's valid in the US" — Rishi | Export format designed to port into incorporation docs |

## Why Stripe Can Win

### 1. Trust Advantage

> "I would trust an Atlas Assistant more, because if Atlas messes up they're messing up for everyone else. I trust Stripe to be quality assuring the content." — Aaron Rodriguez

Founders trust Stripe because:
- **Scale = quality assurance** — Stripe can't afford to give bad advice at scale
- **Skin in the game** — Stripe's reputation is on the line
- **Track record** — Atlas has incorporated 100K+ companies

This trust extends naturally to a pre-incorporation tool. Founders would rather use a Stripe-sponsored agreement template than a random Google result.

### 2. Distribution Advantage

Stripe already reaches founders through:
- **Atlas marketing** — SEO, content, partnerships (YC, accelerators)
- **Stripe Payments** — Many founders use Stripe before incorporating
- **Developer community** — Technical founders already trust Stripe

A pre-inc tool is a **natural extension** of existing channels, not a new GTM motion.

### 3. Data Advantage

The agreement captures:
- Company name and description
- Founder names, emails, roles
- Equity splits and vesting terms
- Decision-making preferences
- Exit scenario expectations

This data:
- **Pre-fills Atlas** — Reduces incorporation friction
- **Qualifies leads** — Multi-founder teams with equity discussions are serious
- **Informs product** — What do founders struggle with? Where do they disagree?

### 4. Workflow Advantage

Unlike standalone tools, Stripe can offer a **continuous workflow**:

```
Pre-Inc Agreement → Atlas Incorporation → Stripe Payments → Atlas Tax/Compliance
```

No competitor can offer this end-to-end journey. The pre-inc agreement is the **first step** in a relationship that spans the company's lifecycle.

### 5. AI Advantage

Stripe has:
- Internal AI capabilities (Claude integration, Atlas AI assistant)
- Engineering resources to build high-quality conversational interfaces
- Trust to deploy AI in high-stakes contexts (founders trust "Atlas AI" more than generic chatbots)

> "I hate the 'AI can make mistakes' caveat. I'm coming to you for the right answer." — Scott (Trufflepig)

Stripe can build an AI-guided interview that founders actually trust.

## Distribution Options

### Option A: Open Source Ecosystem Play

**Model:** Publish CLI and skill.md as OSS. Free forever, community-driven.

**Mechanics:**
```bash
npx @stripe/founders-agreement    # CLI
/founders-agreement               # Claude Code skill
```

**Value to Stripe:**

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Awareness | GitHub stars, HN posts, word-of-mouth |
| Goodwill | "Stripe gives back to founders" narrative |
| Attribution | Output includes "Powered by Stripe Atlas" |
| Feedback loop | Community PRs improve the tool |

**Value to Users:**
- Zero cost, zero friction
- Works offline (CLI)
- No vendor lock-in
- Version-controllable (YAML output)

**Limitations:**
- No direct lead capture
- No persistence/collaboration
- Long/uncertain path to Atlas conversion
- Support burden without revenue

**Best For:** Developer-heavy founder audiences (YC, indie hackers, HN)

**Investment Required:** Low (CLI exists, skill.md exists)

---

### Option B: Top-of-Funnel Lead Capture (Web App)

**Model:** Hosted web app at `atlas.stripe.com/founders-agreement`. Free to use, requires email for export/save.

**Mechanics:**
1. Founder starts interview (no login required)
2. AI guides through all sections
3. To export or save draft → email required
4. To invite co-founder → both emails captured
5. Nurture sequence drives toward Atlas

**Value to Stripe:**

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Lead capture | Email + company info before incorporation intent |
| Lead qualification | Multi-founder + equity discussion = serious |
| Nurture opportunity | "Your draft is waiting. Ready to incorporate?" |
| Data asset | Understand founder dynamics, common equity splits |
| Pre-fill Atlas | Reduce onboarding friction at conversion |

**Value to Users:**
- Collaboration features (share with co-founders)
- Persistent drafts (come back later)
- Professional export formats (PDF, Markdown)
- Clear path to next step (Atlas)

**Limitations:**
- Requires ongoing product investment
- Long lead time to conversion (months/years)
- Some founders never incorporate

**Best For:** Non-technical founders, teams needing async collaboration

**Investment Required:** Medium (web app prototype exists, needs polish + backend)

---

### Option C: Atlas Integration (Step 0 of Incorporation)

**Model:** Pre-inc agreement is the first step of Atlas incorporation flow. Drafts live in Atlas, data flows into incorporation forms.

**Mechanics:**
1. Founder visits Atlas, sees "Not ready to incorporate? Start with a Founders Agreement"
2. Completes interview, saves draft in Atlas account
3. When ready: "Continue to Incorporation" pre-fills all forms
4. Or: Start incorporation, prompted to complete agreement first

**Value to Stripe:**

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Conversion optimization | Pre-filled forms reduce drop-off |
| Earlier relationship | Capture founders months before they'd otherwise arrive |
| Multi-founder capture | Both founders create Atlas accounts |
| Upsell natural | "You've aligned. Ready to make it official?" |
| Reduced support | Founders already understand equity/vesting before incorporation |

**Value to Users:**
- Seamless workflow (no re-entering data)
- Single source of truth (agreement + incorporation in one place)
- Atlas trust extends to pre-inc tool
- Clear "next step" always visible

**Limitations:**
- Requires significant Atlas backend integration
- May feel heavy for very early founders
- Scope creep risk into Atlas core product

**Best For:** Founders with clear incorporation intent (6-12 month horizon)

**Investment Required:** High (Atlas integration, account management, data flow)

### Option D: Hybrid (Recommended)

**Model:** All three channels, optimized for different funnel stages.

```

**Why Hybrid Wins:**
1. **Meets founders where they are** — Some want CLI, some want web, some want Atlas
2. **Progressive commitment** — Low friction entry, increasing engagement
3. **Data portability** — YAML format works across all channels
4. **Defensible moat** — Competitors can copy one channel, not the integrated workflow

## Summary: Why Stripe Should Do This

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Is there demand?** | Yes — UXR shows founders create pre-inc agreements today, poorly |
| **Is there a gap?** | Yes — No one owns this moment; founders Google templates or skip it |
| **Can Stripe win?** | Yes — Trust advantage, distribution advantage, workflow advantage |
| **What's the ROI?** | Earlier relationships → higher Atlas conversion → longer LTV |
| **What's the risk?** | Low — Prototype exists, investment is incremental |

**Bottom line:** The Pre-Incorporation Founders Agreement is a **low-cost, high-leverage wedge** into an extended pre-incorporation window where Stripe currently has no presence. It builds trust, captures leads, and creates a seamless path to Atlas—all while genuinely helping founders avoid a common pain point.

## Appendix: UXR Evidence Base

### Pre-Incorporation Agreement Behavior (n=2)

| Founder | Gap Duration | Agreement Type | Trigger for Incorporation |
|---------|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Rishi | ~15 months | Self-drafted, dual jurisdiction (US + India/Chile) | Customer credibility ("Is it really a company?") |
| Nicole | Not specified | Self-drafted from online template | Angel funding commitment |

### Cohorts with Higher Propensity (from Rishi interview)

- Multi-jurisdictional operations
- Cost-sensitive founders (can't afford $10K+ legal pre-PMF)
- Solo founders managing everything
- Engineer-heavy teams unfamiliar with startup legal
- Non-US founders operating in US
- B2B startups pre-customer

### Key Quotes

> "It's less to do with whether it's legal or more to do with, okay, let's have something in place that we agreed to... mostly based on trust, mutual trust... it's mostly an insurance if something goes south." — Rishi

> "Primary drivers were IP. If something were to fall apart, we knew what it would look like." — Nicole

> "There was no formal role / time commitment / titling in there, and it would have been a good idea." — Nicole

> "For each of those agreements that were done pre-incorporation, we just did a parallel agreement that's valid in the US." — Rishi
