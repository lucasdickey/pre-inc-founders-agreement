# Pre-Incorporation Agreement Feedback from UXR

**Source:** Atlas UXR Notes (Updated Jan 21, 2026)

## Summary

Two interviews directly address pre-incorporation agreements: **Nicole** and **Rishi**. Both created agreements to establish trust, protect IP, and align on ownership *before* committing to incorporation costs.

---

## Nicole (Jan 26, 2026)

### What She Did

> "I did a partnership agreement with my cofounder before we incorporated to set parameters"

### Why

- **IP Protection**: "Primary drivers were IP. If something were to fall apart, we knew what it would look like."
- **Trust Baseline**: Establish mutual understanding before legal commitment
- **Delay Incorporation**: "We did incorporation only once we had commitment of angel money"

### What Was Missing

> "There was no formal role / time commitment / titling in there, and it would have been a good idea."

### Process

- Found a template online, edited it herself (she's a lawyer)
- Agreement was "totally subsumed by incorporation docs" later
- Ended up using the same equity split they'd pre-agreed

### Key Insight

Pre-inc agreement enabled them to **wait to incorporate until they had funding committed**—avoiding premature legal costs while still having alignment.

## Rishi (Undated — Pre-Incorporation Agreements Deep Dive)

### Context

- Ran a multi-jurisdictional startup (2014-15) with teams in SF, India, and Chile
- Delayed incorporation for **~15 months**
- Created extensive pre-incorporation agreements during this period

### Why He Delayed Incorporation

| Reason | Quote |
|--------|-------|
| **Cost sensitivity** | "I didn't want to invest in lawyers and everything before we figured out we had a product that actually worked" |
| **PMF validation** | Wanted 12+ months to validate product/users before legal investment |
| **Multi-jurisdictional complexity** | Incorporating wouldn't solve all problems anyway (India/Chile challenges persisted) |
| **Flexibility** | Easier to operate informally while iterating |

### Types of Pre-Inc Agreements Created

- Advisor compensation agreements (primarily equity-based)
- Contractor agreements
- NDAs and non-competes
- Offer letters
- IP assignment agreements
- Equity grant documentation

### Volume

> "For 10 employees with ~3 agreements each = 30 agreements total"

Created **dual agreements** for every document—one valid in US, one valid in local jurisdiction.

### Trust Over Legal Enforceability

> "It's less to do with whether it's legal or more to do with, okay, let's have something in place that we agreed to"

> "More like a handshake"

> "Mostly based on trust, mutual trust... it's mostly an insurance if something goes south"

Didn't know if agreements were legally valid in each jurisdiction but created them anyway.

### What Risks Were Mitigated

- **IP ownership clarity** — ensuring future company would own all work product
- **Equity clarity** — 10 people all had equity, needed documentation
- **Advisor compensation** — primarily equity-based, needed agreements
- **Exit/dissolution terms** — "ejection clauses" for if someone leaves
- **Employment terms** — offer letters, non-competes
- **Trust baseline** — "insurance if something goes south"

### Incorporation Trigger

> "The biggest inflection point... was less to do with my people I'm working with, or advisors, it's more about to sound legit to the customers I'm selling to"

- B2B customers asked "is it really a company?"
- Needed bank account—"you can't just say, just wire money to [personal account]"
- **NOT driven by**: team size, advisor pressure, equity complexity

### Transition to Incorporation

> "For each of those agreements that were done pre-incorporation, we just did a parallel agreement that's valid in the US"

- Used lawyer to draft US-compliant versions with same terms
- "Slight difference in language"
- Did NOT start from scratch—carried everything over

### Process for Creating Agreements

- Self-drafted (had corporate finance/legal background)
- No formal platforms (pre-Atlas era)
- Google-based research: "Let me Google it, like, how to figure out something that works in India vs. Chile"
- No professional legal counsel until incorporation (cost prohibitive)
- Had to act as "pretend accountant and lawyer" to explain terms to engineers unfamiliar with equity/redlining

### Price Sensitivity

> Would use templates if "$100 per agreement" but "if it's $500 for each agreement, probably not"

At 30 agreements, cost adds up quickly.

## Cohort Propensity Patterns (from Rishi)

**Higher propensity for pre-inc agreements:**

- Multi-jurisdictional operations (biggest factor)
- Cost-sensitive founders (can't afford $10K+ legal bills pre-validation)
- Solo founders managing everything
- Engineer-heavy teams unfamiliar with startup legal concepts
- Non-US founders operating in US (need to bridge jurisdiction gaps)
- B2B startups pre-customer (can delay until customers demand legitimacy)

## Key Themes

| Theme | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Cost avoidance** | Both delayed incorporation to avoid legal fees before PMF |
| **Trust > enforceability** | Agreements were "handshakes" / "insurance if something goes south" |
| **IP protection** | Primary driver for Nicole; included in Rishi's list |
| **Equity alignment** | Both used pre-inc agreements to establish ownership splits |
| **Role/commitment gaps** | Nicole noted she should have included roles/time commitment |
| **Smooth transition** | Both carried pre-inc terms into incorporation docs |
| **Customer credibility as trigger** | Rishi incorporated when B2B customers questioned legitimacy |

---

## Product Implications

1. **Pre-inc agreement templates** could serve cost-sensitive founders validating PMF
2. **Key elements to include**: IP assignment, equity splits, roles/time commitment, exit terms
3. **Transition workflow**: Help founders port pre-inc agreements into incorporation docs
4. **Price sensitivity**: $100/agreement acceptable; $500/agreement is a barrier at volume
